# Black Friday


Our challenge is to have a little app which help us to easy make online shopping in Black Friday:)


We will start with a class Products that will help us describe the products. We have to create at least 5 products with name, brand, price.


class Products(...):
    ...

Once a product has been created, it cannot be updated.
We can use the method def price_after_discount we will calculate the price of products after discount applied according to the known discount percentage.

We need to overload at least one operator, for example compare two products by price. 



We will also have a online store class that is a mutable sequence that holds our products.

class OnlineStore(...):
    ...
    

We can add and delete products from the store.
